Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

Nice work Susan.  I think you did well overall on the final.  Regarding your note about access to patient-level information -- I hope that in real world applications you can use these skills with data that you have access to.

One note on bar charts (by State) - it's often helpful to sort them by value from max to min rather than keep them sorted by state label alphabetically.  It allows easier comparison of relatively closer entries.

I would have like to see how some of these data attributes correlate with one another.  That kind of visualization, jusing scatterplots would have been nice.
