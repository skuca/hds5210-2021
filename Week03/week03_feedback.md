Part 1:  5/5

Part 2:  4.5/5

14.4 - Just a style note that you can reuse a function that you define up higher in a notebook by just using its name `lace_score = LACE(...)`.  That will come in handy.

The syntax `length_of_stay > 7 < 13` isn't going to do what you think, though.  In Python, you have to spell it out in two parts:

`(length_of_stay > 7) and (length_of_stay < 13)` -0.5


Otherwise, nice work throughout.
